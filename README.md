# My Python & Data Science Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my public learning journal! This repository documents my progression from writing simple Python scripts to building complex Data Science and Machine Learning applications.

**`📍 Follow my progress: I update this repository regularly with new projects.`**

## 📂 Project Portfolio

Here is a chronological list of the projects I've completed.

---

### 01. Advanced Batch File Renamer 🔧
A robust Python CLI tool for safely batch-renaming files with features like preview, confirmation, and multiple operations (add prefix/suffix, remove word, change extension).

*   **Concepts:** File I/O (`os` module), user input validation, error handling.
*   **Code:** [View the Project Folder](/batch_file_renamer)
*   **How to Run:** `python file_renamer.py`

---

### 02. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🎮
A console-based game against the computer, featuring a best-of-3 match system, score tracking, and input validation.

*   **Concepts:** Conditional logic, loops, functions, randomness.
*   **Code:** [View the Project Folder](rock_paper_scissors)
*   **How to Run:** `RPS.py`

---
### 03. Weather Fetcher App 🌤️
A Python application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for any city in the world using the OpenWeatherMap API.

*   **Concepts:** API integration, HTTP requests, JSON parsing, data conversion.
*   **Code:** [View the Project Folder](/weather_app)
*   **How to Run:** `python weather.py`
## Dataset
- **`genres.csv`**: Main dataset containing 42,305 songs with audio features and genre information.
- **`playlists.csv`**: Supplementary file mapping playlist IDs to genres.

## Key Questions Explored
1. What are the most common music genres in the dataset?
2. Which genres have the highest danceability and energy?
3. What are the correlations between different audio features?
4. How does song duration vary across different genres?

## Expected Findings
- The dataset likely shows a diverse distribution of genres
- High-energy genres like Electronic or Hip-Hop may have higher danceability
- Strong correlations between related audio features (e.g., energy and loudness)
- Different genres may have characteristic song lengths

## How to Run
python spotify_analysis.py

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
